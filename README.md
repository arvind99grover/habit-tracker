	Install Redux and React Router: npm install redux react-redux react-router-dom

2. Folder structure:
	Create the following folder structure:

3. Implement the Redux store and reducers:
	In src/actionTypes.js, define the action types for adding habits, updating habit statuses, etc.
	In src/actions.js, create action creators for the defined action types.
	In src/reducers.js, create a reducer function to handle the state updates based on the dispatched actions.

4. Implement the components:
	In src/components/Habit.js, create a component to display a single habit and allow toggling its status.
	In src/components/Habits.js, create a component to render all the habits and handle adding new habits.
	In src/components/HabitForm.js, create a form component to add new habits.
	In src/components/Day.js, create a component to display the status of a habit for a specific day.
	In src/components/Week.js, create a component to display the status of a habit for the past 7 days.
	In src/components/WeekView.js, create a component to show the current habits and their statuses for the past 7 days.
	In src/components/App.js, create the main app component that handles routing and renders the necessary components based on the URL.
	
5. Implement the routing:
	In src/App.js, use react-router-dom to define routes for the main views: current habits and week view.
	Set up the navigation links and route components in App.js.
	
6. Style the components:
	Use the CSS files in the src/Styles folder to style the respective components.

7. Test the app:
	Start the development server: npm start
	Open the app in your browser and test the functionality.
